I know that there are some students might have the same assignment.
But please don't copy the code, since your teacher will find my code as well.

Artificial-Intelligence-Projects
================================

Including 5 projects that are implemented in the Artificial Intelligence course.


The 5 projects are:

- Algorithms of 8-puzzles, including BFS, DFS, IDS, A Star, IDA Star
- Othello: Creating an agent that plays the game Reversi (also known by the trademark Othello). Reversi is a two-person, full information game.
- Usenet posting classifier: Categorize and classify Usenet postings using some basic information retrieval methods. It is working with the 20 Newsgroups dataset.
- Decision tree classifier: Construct a decision tree, and then using it to classify instances from several different datasets
- Sentiment classification system: A very simple sentiment classification system that could handle negation. It runs on the pros/cons dataset using the opinion lexicon. For each sentence in the text (delimited by <Pros></Pros> or <Cons></Cons>), count the number of positive and negative sentiment words, and classify the sentence as positive if there are more positive sentiment words, negative otherwise.
